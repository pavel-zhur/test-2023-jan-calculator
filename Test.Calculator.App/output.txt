A normal expression example:
(2 + (((6 / 2) * 2)!)) = 722
sum of 2 and faculty of multiplication of division of 6 by 2 and 2 is 722

A subnormal result example:
(2 + (3 / 0)) = ∞
sum of 2 and division of 3 by 0 could not be calculated precisely, the result value is too high. A division by zero is probable.

An exception example:
(((5 / 2) * 2)!) = 120
faculty of multiplication of division of 5 by 2 and 2 is 120

A known bug example:
((5.6 + 5.8) - 0.4) = 10.999999999999998
sum of 5.6 and 5.8 minus 0.4 is 10.999999999999998
